"""
The **gameflow** subpackage is dedicated to managing dynamic game state evolution and adaptive simulation mechanics.
It provides the backbone for event-driven simulation, real-time adjustments, and long-term forecasting. GameFlow is
designed to support complex scenarios where the game state evolves continuously through external shocks, adaptive AI
strategies, feedback loops, and emergent behaviors. Its modular design enables easy integration with other GameForge
components.


**Key Modules and Their Roles:**

event_triggers.py:
Defines various event trigger classes (Timed, Conditional, Random) that detect and execute game-changing events based on game state, time, or probabilistic conditions.

adaptive_strategies.py:
Contains classes and interfaces to update and adjust player strategies dynamically. It supports specialized adjusters (e.g., economic, political) for recalculating optimal moves as conditions evolve.

historical_simulation.py:
Provides tools for loading historical data and simulating scenarios that mirror real-world events. This module is critical for “what-if” analyses and benchmarking simulation outputs against historical trends.

escalation.py:
Manages the progression of crises or pivotal events. It encapsulates mechanisms for tracking escalation levels and applying corresponding effects on the game state.

dynamic_equilibria.py:
Focuses on recalculating game equilibria as conditions shift, ensuring that strategic balances reflect changes in player incentives and external conditions.

feedback_loops.py:
Implements both positive and negative feedback loops that can either amplify or dampen game dynamics. This module is vital for capturing self-reinforcing cycles in the simulation.

probabilistic_outcomes.py:
Introduces stochastic elements to model uncertainty, risk, and random events, ensuring that not every outcome is deterministic.

real_time_adjustments.py:
Provides functionality for continuous updating of the game state, enabling near real-time adaptation rather than waiting for discrete turns.

long_horizon_forecasting.py:
Offers predictive analytics and simulation tools that forecast future game states, allowing AI agents and players to plan over extended horizons.

auto_balance.py:
Detects imbalances in the simulation and automatically adjusts parameters (e.g., resource distribution, payoff structures) to maintain competitive fairness.

emergent_behavior.py:
Captures and analyses unexpected patterns or strategies that emerge during gameplay. It allows for both logging and corrective interventions if emergent behaviors destabilize the simulation.


**Intended Usage:**

Developers integrate GameFlow to ensure that simulations remain dynamic and responsive. It is used to trigger and manage external shocks, adapt strategies in real time, and model complex phenomena such as market bubbles, political crises, or environmental disasters—all within a continuously evolving game framework.
